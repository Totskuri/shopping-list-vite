Refactor to use TypeScript? Maybe in a perfect world...

To-do:
- Refactor to use react query hooks, add error handling
- Check RLS policies
- Add support for sharing lists
- Add support for realtime polling (shared lists)
- Create logo and redesign ui elements
- Add backdrop and animation for drawer
- Move delete behind edit (or have edit and delete in menu)
- Get domain
- Add favicon and basic seo elements
- Create info page
- Release 1.0

Bugs:
- "New list" button goes behind mobile browser menu
- Mobile keyboard opens above drawer
